Videos in our Mixamo-Video dataset is rendered from the 3D models downloaded from [mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com). Each video is a combination of a character and an animation.

Due to the copyright problem, we give the lists of identities and animations used in the Mixamo-Video dataset in `identity.txt` and `animation.txt` , respectively.
